# Intro to Docker

## Pulling and running an existing image

Pull a public image such as ubuntu or centos using the docker pull command.  If a tag is not specified, docker will default to "latest".

```bash
$ docker pull ubuntu:14.04
```

Now run the image using the docker run command.  Use the "-it" option to get an interactive terminal during the run.

```bash
$ docker run -it ubuntu:14.04
$ whoami
$ lsb_release -a
```

## Making changes and committing them

Using standard linux commands, modify the image.  

```bash
$ docker run -it ubuntu:14.04
root@949eb1a6a099:/# (echo '#!/bin/bash'|echo "echo 'Hello World'") > /bin/hello
$ chmod 755 /bin/hello
# Test it
$ hello
# Exit
$ exit
```

Now find the container and commit the changes to a new image called hello.
```bash
docker ps -a|head -2
# Grab the Container ID
docker commit <ID> hello
```

Now try running the new image with your changes.

```bash
docker run -it hello
hello
```

## Creating and building a Dockerfile

While manually modifying and commiting changes is one way to build images, using a Dockerfile provides a way to build images so that others can understand how the image was constructed and make modifications.

A Dockerfile has many options.  We will focus on a few basic ones (FROM, MAINTAINER, ADD, and RUN)

Create a simple shell script called script in your local directory using your favorite editor.

```
#!/bin/bash
echo "Lisa says Hello World!"
```

Now create a file called Dockerfile in the same directory with contents similar to this.  Use your own name and e-mail for the maintainer.

```
FROM ubuntu:14.04
MAINTAINER Lisa Gerhardt <lgerhardt@lbl.gov>

ADD ./input_files/script /bin/script
RUN mv /bin/script /bin/hello && chmod a+rx /bin/hello
```

Now build the image using the docker build command.  Be sure to use the `-t` option to tag it.  Tell the Dockerfile to build using the current directory by specifying `.`.  Alternatively you could place the Dockerfile and script in an alternate location and specify that directory in the docker build command.

```bash
docker build -t hello:1.0 .
```

Try running the image.

```bash
docker run -it hello:1.0
hello
```

## Pushing a Dockerfile to dockerhub

Docker provides a public hub that can be use to store and share images.  Before pushing an image, you will need to create an account at Dockerhub.  Go to [https://cloud.docker.com/](https://cloud.docker.com/) to create the account.  Once the account is created, push your test image using the docker push command.  In this example, we will assume the username is patsmith.

```bash
docker tag hello:1.0 patsmith/hello:1.0
docker push patsmith/hello:1.0
```

The first push make take some time depending on your network connection and the size of the image.

## Hands on Activity: MPI hello world

Now that you've practiced loading a simple script, try creating an image that can run this short MPI hello word code:

```code
// Hello World MPI app
#include <mpi.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
    int size, rank;
    char buffer[1024];

    MPI_Init(&argc, &argv);

    MPI_Comm_size(MPI_COMM_WORLD, &size);
    MPI_Comm_rank(MPI_COMM_WORLD, &rank);

    gethostname(buffer, 1024);

    printf("hello from %d of %d on %s\n", rank, size, buffer);

    MPI_Barrier(MPI_COMM_WORLD);

    MPI_Finalize();
    return 0;
}
```
Hints: 
* You can start with the image "nersc/ubuntu-mpi:14.04". It already has MPI installed.
* You compile with "mpicc helloworld.c -o /app/hello"

Dockerfile:
```bash
# MPI Dockerfile
FROM nersc/ubuntu-mpi:14.04

ADD helloworld.c /app/

RUN cd /app && mpicc helloworld.c -o /app/hello
```

docker build -t mydockerid/hellompi:latest .

docker push mydockerid/hellompi:latest

Log into the image and run the app:

docker run -it mydockerid/hellompi:latest

root@982d980864e5:/# mpirun -n 10 /app/hello
hello from 3 of 10 on 982d980864e5

hello from 4 of 10 on 982d980864e5

hello from 7 of 10 on 982d980864e5

hello from 9 of 10 on 982d980864e5

hello from 2 of 10 on 982d980864e5

hello from 5 of 10 on 982d980864e5

hello from 8 of 10 on 982d980864e5

hello from 0 of 10 on 982d980864e5

hello from 6 of 10 on 982d980864e5

hello from 1 of 10 on 982d980864e5
